About Chef Community Organization

The idea here is to create an organization that can "adopt" maintenance of
repositories and cookbooks that have lost their maintainers.

Interested parties can volunteer to be on a team for a given repository, and
contribute via Pull Requests.

This removes a bit of the onus on an individual or company that no longer wants
to maintain a cookbook, and is willing to transfer ownership to the community of
committed volunteers.
